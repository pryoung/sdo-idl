# sdo-idl
IDL software of Peter Young (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center) useful for the analysis of SDO (AIA &amp; HMI) data.

Some of these routines are available in Solarsoft (sdo/aia/idl/pryoung), but this GitHub repository has the most up-to-date versions of the routines.

Additional information is at https://pyoung.org/quick_guides/pry_sdo_guide.html.
